# Income, Density, and Transit Mode Share

Exploring household income, neighbourhood density, and the transit mode share of commuting trips in Vancouver using 2016 Census data.

The data is queried using the amazing `cancensus` package and the visualization is created using `ggplot2`, `plotly` and `crosstalk` packages. The `crosstalk` library enables linked brushing (coupled events) between plots without the need to create shiny apps.

The ['Greater Vancouver A (RDA)'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Vancouver_Electoral_Area_A) census subdivision includes UBC's main campus which explains the high transit mode share despite the low density.
